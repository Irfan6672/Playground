In the first part of today's sprint, you will be working on some familiar looking tasks, but with a twist - what was once callback-based is now entirely promise-based!

You will still be using a provided request function to solve the first few problems, but this request function now only takes one argument - a string representing an endpoint - and it returns a promise. The data that the server responds with on the available endpoints provided (detailed below) is identical to what it was yesterday, only now you access the resulting values by using .then() instead of traditional callbacks.

You should take this opportunity to compare the callback-based solutions from yesterday with your promise-based solutions of today to deepen your understanding of the differences and similarities between the two approaches.

Tests are provided for these challenges, and you should use them to help you build your solutions as you go.
